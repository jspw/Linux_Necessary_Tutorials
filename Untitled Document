                            how to install tgz file in ubuntu




    .tgz is an archive like zip or rar.
    Right click on the file and select Extract Here.
    cd to the extracted folder.
    Then type ./configure
    To install type make and then make install.
    There will be a Read me file with instruction on how to install the file.
    However the installation will differ based on the different packages.
    So before installing the .tgz files i would strongly advice you to look at the read me file.
    But installing software not in the software centre can be tricky and will not always work without some advanced knowledge.
